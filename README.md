# Machine Learning Zoomcamp
This is my learning journey in [machine learning zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp) organized by [DataTalksClub](https://datatalks.club/)
<br><br>
I first started my machine learning journey with this course, and I am grateful to DataTalksClub for making this course happen. ðŸ¥°

# Week 7: Project
This week, we start to do a midterm project. I used multi-class classification project on energy load type classification.<br>
The project is done from experiment to containarization.<br><br>
Here is my project repo - [Energy Consumption Model](https://github.com/Hokfu/Energy-Consumption-Model)
# Week 8: Deep Learning
- Image Classification
- Tensorflow Keras
- Transfer learning
- Data Augmentation
- [Link](Week8%20Imagine%20Classification)
# Capstone Project
For my final project of the course, I did flower image classification with [Tensorflow Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) and [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning). The data is the flower images of daisy and dandelion.<br><br>
